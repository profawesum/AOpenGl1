# AOpenGl1
Summative 1 for OpenGL WIP

Currently Has:


C:
- Enable backface culling, Antialiasing and Scissor test. 
- The demo can be restarted without exiting the application.(The user can press p to reset the player and camera position back to the       original points.) 


B:
- Create transparent water effect on a quad. Add another opaque quad  below the transparent quad to see the transparent quad in effect.
- Add a cube and add fog effect on it. 


Needs:


C:
 - Enabled stencil test and produce stencil around an object.(Stencil Test is enabled, but does not produce a working stencil) 


B:
 - Add a movable camera to move the camera front and back to see the cube change to fog color.(Camera Now Rotates and Moves, does not yet    change fog color)
  
  
A:
 - Apply fog effect on all objects in the scene including the water surface and quad underneath it and stencilled object. Make clearscreen    color the same color as the fog.(The fog is applied to the transparent surface and the one under it, there is no stencilled object yet    and the clearscreen color is not the same as the fog color) 
 - Enable mouse picking on a quad and use it as a button. Create 2 buttons to move the camera back and front in the scene.
